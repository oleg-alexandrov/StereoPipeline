*** RELEASE 2.4.3, upcoming! ***

 - General
   * Upgraded to ISIS 3.4.9.

 - stereo
   * Increase the default correlation timeout to 1800 seconds.

 - point2dem
   * Fixed a slight discrepancy in the value of the semi-minor axis in
     the WGS84 and NAD83 datum implementations.
   * Added the option --median-filter-params <window size> <threshold> to
     remove outliers using a median filter.
   * Added the option --erode-length <num> to erode pixels from point cloud 
     boundary (after outliers are removed, but before filling in holes).
   * Improved hole-filling, and removed the --hole-fill-mode and 
     --hole-fill-num-smooth-iter, as there's only one algorithm now. 
   * Improved performance when large holes are to be filled.
   * Can create DEM from a point cloud stored in a CSV file containging
     easting, northing, and height above datum (the PROJ.4 string
     needed to interpret these numbers should be set with --csv-proj4).

 - pc_align
   * Can ingest CSV files containging easting, northing, and height
   * above datum (the PROJ.4 string needed to interpret these numbers
   * should be set with --csv-proj4).

 - point2las
   * Added the ability to specify a custom projection (PROJ.4 string).

 - dem_mosaic
   * Write GeoTIFF files with blocks of size 256 x 256 as those
     may be faster to process with GDAL tools.
   * Bug fix when the tool is used to re-project.
   * Added the option --weights-blur-sigma <num> to allow the blending
     weights to be blurred by a gaussian to increase their smoothless.
   * Added the option --weight-exponent <num>, to allow weights
     to increase faster than linearly.
   * Added the ability to fill holes in the output mosaic.

 - image2qtree
   * Bug fixes.
 
 - cam2map4stereo.py
   * Create temporary files in current directory, to avoid access
     issues to system directories.
 
*** RELEASE 2.4.2, October 6, 2014 ***

 - ASP can perform multi-view triangulation (using both the
     stereo and parallel_stereo tools). The first image is set
     as reference, disparities are computed from it to the other 
     ones, and joint triangulation is performed.

 - Added a new tool, dem_mosaic, for mosaicking a large number of 
   DEMs, with erosion at boundary, smooth blending, and tiled output.
   Instead of blending, the tool can do the first, last, min, max,
   mean, median, or count of encountered DEM values.   

 - dg_mosaic
   * Support for multi-band (multi-spectral) images. Use --band <num>
     to pick a band to mosaic.
      
 - stereo
   * Bugfix in interest point matching in certain circumstances.
   * Set the correlation timeout to 600 seconds. This is generous
     and ensures runs don't stall. 
 
 - point2dem
   * Take as input n clouds and optionally n texture files, create a
     single DEM/orthoimage.
   * Take as input LAS and CSV files in addition to ASP's PC format.
   * Fix a bug in the interplay of hole-filling and outlier removal
     for orthoimage creation.
   * Ensure that the DEM grid is always at integer multiples of the
     grid size. This way, two DEMs with overlapping grids of the same
     size will be exactly on top of each other, minimizing interpolation
     error in subsequent mosaicking.
   * Outlier removal is on by default. Can be disabled by setting 
     the percentage in --remove-outliers-params to 100.
 
 - bundle_adjust
   * Use multiple-threads for non-ISIS sessions.
   * Added the parameter --overlap-limit <num> to limit the number 
     of subsequent images to search for matches to the current image.
   * Added the parameter --camera-weight <val>, to set the weight to
     give to the constraint that the camera positions/orientations
     stay close to the original values (only for the Ceres solver).

 - dem_geoid
   * Support the EGM2008 geoid. The geoid surface across all Earth
     is computed with an error of less than 1.5 cm compared to the
     values generated by harmonic synthesis. A 2.5 x 2.5 minute grid
     is used.
   * Converted the EGM geoids shipped with ASP to INT16 and JPEG2000,
     resulting in size reduction of more than 10x. 

 - wv_correct
    * Corrects TDI of 16, 48, 56, and 64 (forward and reverse scan
      directions) for WV01, TDI of 8 (forward only) for WV01, and TDI
      of 16, 48, 64 (forward and reverse scan directions) for
      WV02. Returns uncorrected images in other cases.

 - pc_align
    * Fix a crash for very large clouds.  
    * Use a progress bar when loading data.
    * Support LAS files on input and output.

 - point2las
    * Bugfix when saving LAS files in respect to a datum.

 - Documentation
    * Move the non-ISIS-specific tutorial sections onto its own
      chapter, to be read by both ISIS and Earth users. Updates and
      cleanup.

*** RELEASE 2.4.1, 12 July, 2014 ***

  - Added a new tool, bundle_adjust, which uses Google's ceres-solver
    to solve for adjusted camera positions and orientations. Works
    for n images and cameras, for all camera types supported by ASP. 

  - wv_correct
    * Improved corrections for WV01 images of TDI 16.

  - stereo_rfne
    * Performance bugfix when the integer disparity is noisy.
 
  - stereo_fltr
    * Fix for large memory usage when removing small islands from
      disparity with --erode-max-size.

  - stereo_tri
    * Bugfixes for MER cameras.

  - stereo_tri and mapproject
    * Added the option --bundle-adjust-prefix to read adjusted
      camera models obtained by previously running bundle_adjust with
      this output prefix.

  - point2las
    * LAS files can be saved in geo-referenced format in respect 
      to a specified datum (option --reference-spheroid).
 
  - point2dem
    * Bugfix, longitude could be off by 360 degrees.
    * Robustness to large jumps in point cloud values.

  - pc_align
    * Ability to read and write CSV files having UTM data (easting,
      northing, height above datum).
    * Read DEMs in the ISIS cube format.

*** RELEASE 2.4.0, 28 April, 2014 ***

  - Added wv_correct, a tool for correcting artifacts in Digital Globe
    WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 images with TDI of 16.
  - Added logging to a file for stereo, pc_align, point2dem, 
    point2mesh, point2las, and dem_geoid.
  - Added a tutorial for processing Digital Globe Earth imagery
    and expanded the MOC tutorial.
  - Bug fixes in mosacking of Digital Globe images.

  - parallel_stereo
     * Use dynamic load balancing for improved performance.
     * Automatically determine the optimal number of processes
       and threads for each stage of stereo.

  - stereo_pprc
     * Added the --skip-image-normalization option (for non-ISIS 
       images and alignment-method none), it can help with reducing
       the size of data on disk and performance.
       
  - stereo_rfne
     * Added new affine subpixel refinement mode when 
       --subpixel-mode = 3. This mode sacrifices the error resistance
       of Bayes EM mode in exchange for reduced computation time.
       For some data sets this can perform as well as Bayes EM in
       about one fifth the time.

  - stereo_fltr:
     * Hole-filling is disabled by default in stereo_fltr. It is 
       suggested to use instead point2dem's analogous functionality.
       It can be re-enabled using --enable-fill-holes.
     * Added the option --erode-max-size to remove isolated blobs.
     * Relaxed filtering of disparities, retaining more valid
       disparities. Can be adjusted with --filter-mode and related
       parameters.

  - stereo_tri:
    * Added ability to save triangulation error for a DEM as a 3D
      North-East-Down vector rather than just its magnitude.
    * When acting on map-projected images, handle the case when the 
      DEM used for map-projection does not completely encompass the 
      images.
 
  - pc_align:
    * Read and write CSV files in a wide variety of formats, using 
      the --csv-format option.
    * Display the translation component of the rigid alignment
      transform in the local North-East-Down coordinate system, as
      well as the centroid of source points used in alignment.
    * Save to disk the convergence history (iteration information).
    * Added the ability to explicitly specify the datum semi-axes.
    * Bug fix for saving transformed clouds for Moon and Mars.
    * More efficient processing of reference and source points
      by loading only points in each cloud within a neighborhood
      of the long/lat bounding box of the other cloud.
    * Make it possible to generate ortho and error images using
      point2dem with the transformed clouds output by pc_align.

  - point2dem:
     * Replaced the core algorithm. Instead of sampling the point
       cloud surface, which is prone to aliasing, the DEM height at a
       given grid point is obtained as a weighted average of heights
       of all points in the cloud within search radius of the grid
       point, with the weights given by a Gaussian. The cutoff of the
       Gaussian can be controlled using the --search-radius-factor
       option. The old algorithm is still available (but obsoleted)
       using the --use-surface-sampling option. The new algorithm
       makes the --fsaa option redundant. 
     * Added the ability to remove outliers by triangulation error,
       either automatically (--remove-outliers) or manually, with 
       given error threshold (--max-valid-triangulation-error).
     * Added two algorithms to fill holes in the output DEM and 
       orthoimage (--hole-fill-mode).
     * The way the default DEM spacing is computed was modified, 
       to make dependent only on the local distribution of points
       in the cloud and robust to outliers. 
     * Can handle highly noisy input point clouds without spikes in 
       memory usage and processing time.
     * Improved memory usage and performance for large point clouds.
     * Bug fix, the DEM was shifted by 1 pixel from true location.

*** RELEASE 2.3.0, 19 November, 2013 ***

TOOLS

  - Added pc_align, a tool for aligning point clouds, using the
    libpointmacher library
    (https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher). Sparse and dense
    point clouds are supported, as well as DEMs. Two ICP methods are
    supported, point-to-plane and point-to-point. Memory and processing
    usage are proportional to the desired number of input points
    to use rather than to the overall input data sizes.

  - Added lronac2mosaic.py, a tool for merging the LE and RE images
    from the LRONAC camera into a single map-projected image.  The
    output images can be fed into the stereo tool to generate DEMs.
  
  - rpc_maprpoject and orthoproject are combined into a single tool
    for projecting a camera image onto a DEM for any camera model
    supported by Stereo Pipeline. The old orthoproject is kept for 
    backward compatibility for a while.

GENERAL 


  - Stereo Pipeline (almost) daily and fully verfied builds for all
    platforms are available for the adventurous user
    (http://byss.arc.nasa.gov/stereopipeline/daily_build/). When
    requesting support, please provide the output of "stereo --version".

  - The size of Stereo Pipeline output data has been reduced, by up to
    40%, particularly point clouds and DEMs are between 30% to 70%
    smaller.  Better encoding is used, output data is rounded (up to 1
    mm), and point clouds are offset and saved as float instead of
    double.
    
  - Timeout option added for stereo correlation, preventing
    unreasonably long correlation times for certain image tiles.

  - Subpixel mosaicing in dg_mosaic uses bilinear interpolation
    instead of nearest neighbor avoiding artifacts in certain
    situations.

  - dg_mosaic can generate a combined RPC model in addition to the
    combined DG model. It accepts flags for specifying input and 
    output nodata values.

  - point2dem with the --fsaa option for reducing aliasing at
    low-resolution DEM generation has been improved as to remove the
    erosion of of valid data close to no-data values.

  - Bugfixes for parallel_stereo, point2dem, etc. 

*** RELEASE 2.2.2, 17 MAY 2013 ***
    (incremented from 2.2.1 after one more bugfix)

TOOLS
 - stereo_mpi renamed to parallel_stereo and made to work
   on any machines with shared storage, rather than just on 
   supercomputers using Intel's MPI library. Bug fixes for
